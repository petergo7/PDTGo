# PDTGo
A private repository for the Predictive Demonstration of Text Generation (PDTGo). The model files contain a model description, change log, and a main.py file as a basic setup. Then, there can be datasets, examples, and others. The PDTGo is NOT an AI. It is a simple predictive text paragraph generator model. This can be further developed into an AI, but is far less powerful than models like LaMDA, GPT, or others. The text generation does not and will never know how to include facts, citations, and others due to it's limited dictionary and the fact that it's only information can be from my previously written school essays. Whatever it generates may not be correct, make sense, and precautions should be taken to stop it from going into an infinite loop.
